            <p>
            rboom is a fork of the popular Doom source port PRBoom+. the name "rboom" is short for "retarded boom."<br>
            this version of the port incorporates numerous additional features and options that are unnecessary.<br>
            while prboom+ is a good and worthy source port, rboom reverses that and addes uncompatibility options and makes your gameplay even worse.<br>
            if you dont like it, too bad. go use gzdoom or something better (like prboom+!)<br>
