		<h2>about</h2>
		<p>
			rboom is a fork of the popular Doom source port prboom+. the name "rboom" is short for "retarded boom." this version of the port incorporates numerous additional features and options that are unnecessary. while prboom+ is a good and worthy source port, rboom reverses that and addes uncompatibility options and makes your gameplay even worse. if you dont like it, too bad go use gzdoom or something
